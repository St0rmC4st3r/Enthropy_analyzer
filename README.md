# Enthropy_analyzer
As tasked by Computer Systems lab work #1

main.py - the analyzer. Usage:
python main.py <target file> [excel]

Where <target file> is the file you want to analyze and [excel] is an option if you want the results be easily copypastable in a table processor.

Basedifyer.py - my implementation of base64. It is using literals because I am a very bad person.

Both programmes just spit out files with results into wherever the source was.
